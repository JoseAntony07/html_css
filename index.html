<!-- 

1. Text Formatting Tags:

- <b>: Bold text — Used to make text bold, but without emphasizing its importance.
- <i>: Italic text — Used to italicize text without adding emphasis.
- <mark>: Marked text — Highlights or marks text, usually with a yellow background.
- <small>: Smaller text — Displays the text in a smaller size compared to surrounding text.
- <del>: Deleted text — Shows the text as "struck-through," indicating deletion or removal.
- <ins>: Inserted text — Shows the text as newly added or inserted, typically underlined.
- <sub>: Subscript text — Displays the text slightly below the normal line, like for chemical formulas (e.g., H₂O).
- <sup>: Superscript text — Displays the text slightly above the normal line, like for exponents (e.g., x²).
- <p>: Paragraph — Used to define blocks of text as paragraphs.
- <h1> to <h6>: Headings — Define headings from the most important (`<h1>`) to the least important (`<h6>`).
- <br />: Line break — Creates a line break in the text, an empty tag (self-closing).
- <hr />: Horizontal rule — Creates a horizontal line, often used to separate content.

2. Semantic Tags (Structure + Meaning):

- These tags give structure and add extra meaning to the text. They help with accessibility
  and search engines understand the context of the content.

- <strong>: Important text — Used for strong emphasis, often rendered as bold, similar to `<b>`, but carries more meaning for assistive technologies like screen readers.
- <em>: Emphasized text — Used for emphasis, often rendered as italic, similar to `<i>`, but with additional meaning.
- <abbr>: Abbreviation — Defines an abbreviation or acronym, often with a title attribute explaining the full form (e.g., `<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>`).
- <q>: Quotation — Defines a short inline quotation.
- <dfn>: Definition — Used to indicate a definition of a term, typically with the term being defined inside the tag.
- <cite>: Citation — Used to cite a reference or source (often rendered in italics).
- <address>: Contact Information — Used for contact details, such as email, phone number, or address.
- <s>: Strikethrough (no longer accurate/valid) — Indicates information that is no longer accurate or valid, similar to `<del>`, but not used to signify deletion (e.g., for marking old prices).

Notes:

- Accessibility: Blind users using screen readers will understand these semantic tags and read the content
                 correctly with the added meaning.
- Search Engines: Semantic tags help search engines better understand the content structure and its importance,
                   which can improve SEO.
