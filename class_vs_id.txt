1) <div class="card featured">Featured Item</div>

- The class attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. Multiple elements can share the same class name,
  allowing you to apply the same styles or behaviors to them.

- Use class for styling multiple elements that share the same styles or behaviors. It allows for reusability and flexibility.


2) <h1 id="main-title">Welcome to My Website</h1>

- The id attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an HTML element. Each id must be unique within a page,
  meaning no two elements should have the same id.

- Use id for uniquely identifying a specific element that will be styled or manipulated individually. 
  It is essential for JavaScript functionality and creating anchor links.


Good Practice:
--------------

- Keep in mind that using id for styling purposes is generally discouraged since IDs are meant to be unique.
  For styles that apply to multiple elements, always prefer class.


Example for multi class in single element:
------------------------------------

- <element class="class1 class2 class3">Content here</element>

- <div class="box highlight large">This is a box with multiple classes.</div>

.box {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 10px;
}

.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}

.large {
    font-size: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
}
