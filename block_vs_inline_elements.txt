### Block Elements
- **Definition**: Block elements are HTML elements that occupy the full width available, causing a line break before and after the element. They create a "block" of content.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Start on a new line.
  - Take up the full width of their parent container by default.
  - Can contain other block and inline elements.
- **Examples**:
  - `<div>`: A generic container for grouping elements.
  - `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`: Headings of different levels.
  - `<p>`: A paragraph.
  - `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered lists.
  - `<blockquote>`: A section that is quoted from another source.
  - `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`: Semantic elements for layout.

### Inline Elements
- **Definition**: Inline elements are HTML elements that only take up as much width as necessary, allowing other elements to be displayed on the same line.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Do not start on a new line.
  - Only take up the width of their content.
  - Cannot contain block elements (but can contain other inline elements).
- **Examples**:
  - `<span>`: A generic inline container for text.
  - `<a>`: A hyperlink.
  - `<img>`: An image.
  - `<strong>`: Important text, typically bold.
  - `<em>`: Emphasized text, typically italicized.
